Stage Agents
In agents declared within a stage, the options are invoked before allocating the agent and before checking any when conditions. In this case, when using timeout, it is applied before the agent is allocated. The time to allocate the agent is included in the limit set by the timeout option.

pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            agent any
            options {
                // Timeout counter starts BEFORE agent is allocated
                timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS')
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
